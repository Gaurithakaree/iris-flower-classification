Machine Learning project to classify iris flowers using Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree with Scikit-learn.
 Iris Flower Classification

This project uses machine learning to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

 Dataset

- Source: Iris dataset from Scikit-learn
- Features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width

 What I Did

1. Loaded the dataset using Scikit-learn
2. Preprocessed the data (checked missing values, scaled features)
3. Split the data into training and testing sets
4. Trained three models: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree
5. Evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
6. Visualized the data using PCA and plotted a confusion matrix

 Results

All three models performed well, with Logistic Regression and KNN giving the highest accuracy.

 Libraries Used

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

 How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook (`iris_classification.ipynb`)
3. Run all the cells step-by-step
